Introduction

According to a new voting and registration table released by the U.S. Census Bureau, voter turnout increased as age, educational attainment, and income increased. Knowing this fact, I want to analyze how voter turnout increased as education attainment increased.[Voting and Registration](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html). So to do this analysis, I picked Maryland and examined for each of the counties how education background is directly proportional to voter turnout. The data is downloaded from this website [Citizen, Voting-Age Population By Educational Attainment](https://www.socialexplorer.com/data/ACS2021_5yr/metadata/?ds=ACS21_5yr&table=B29002) for the five-year 2017â€“2021 citizen voter population by education attainment.

Once the file and data were uploaded and converted to a usable format for R Studio, I manipulated the data using applicable functions such as ggplot , geom_sf, and scale_fill_viridis_c in R Studio to filter out and plot maps that illustrate the analysis of education background and voting turnout. I also used QGIS to present polished maps that include layout.
