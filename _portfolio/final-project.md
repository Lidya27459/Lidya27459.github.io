Introduction

According to new voting and registration table released by the U.S census Bureau stated that Voter turnout increased as age, educational attainment and income increased. Know this fact I want to analysis that how voter turnout increased as education attainment increases [Voting and Registration](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html). So to do this analysis I pick Maryland and see for each county how education background is directly proportional to voter turnout.  The data is downloaded from this website [Citizen, Voting-Age Population By Educational Attainment](https://www.socialexplorer.com/data/ACS2021_5yr/metadata/?ds=ACS21_5yr&table=B29002)
