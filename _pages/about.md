Hi, I'm Lidya, a passionate Geography and Environmental Science student about to graduate from UMBC. I am excited to embark on a career that combines my love for the environment and my desire to make a positive impact on the world.

Throughout my time at UMBC, I have gained a deep understanding of various geographical concepts and environmental issues. My studies have equipped me with a strong foundation in areas such as spatial analysis, climate change, and sustainable development. I have also developed expertise in using GIS software, including ESRI ArcGIS and QGIS, to analyze geospatial data and derive meaningful insights.

In addition to my coursework, I have actively engaged in different projects related to mapping and remote sensing. I have worked on projects involving land cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring using satellite imagery. These experiences have allowed me to gain hands-on experience in processing and analyzing remote sensing data, as well as producing accurate and visually appealing maps.

What truly drives me is the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to address real-world challenges. I am committed to finding solutions that promote environmental sustainability and create a better future for communities and ecosystems. By leveraging my expertise in mapping and remote sensing, I strive to contribute to effective land management, conservation efforts, and disaster response initiatives.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have actively sought opportunities to collaborate with professionals and researchers in the field. I have participated in conferences and workshops, expanding my network and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in mapping and remote sensing technologies.
As I approach graduation, I am eager to contribute my skills and dedication to environmental organizations, research institutions, or governmental bodies. I am excited to explore opportunities that allow me to apply my expertise in areas such as spatial data analysis, land use planning, or environmental impact assessment.
